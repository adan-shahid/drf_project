In simple token authentication, we have the power to delete it from the database manually by ourselves.

But in JWT authentication, we have fixed time limit of 5 minutes. after that we can do anything, but in between that 5 mins,we cannot revoke the access token. We can only revoke access by deleting the complete user.

JWT token can be stored in the local storage of browser, not in the database.
